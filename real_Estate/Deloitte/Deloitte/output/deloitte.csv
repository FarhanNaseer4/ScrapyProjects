        Potential ASC 842 Implications",Background,"Over the past several years, more and more companies have been
                    going public, either via a traditional initial public offering (IPO) or a merger
                    with a special-purpose acquisition company (SPAC). Regardless of how a company
                    goes public, it may encounter certain complexities when complying with the
                    presentation and disclosure requirements of the leasing guidance in ASC 842 This  Determining the appropriate date by which the ASC 842 requirements

                    evaluate their unique circumstances when assessing the relevant accounting and
                    financial reporting implications. Such an evaluation may include (1)
                    understanding the financial statements that must be included in any SEC filing,
                    (2) determining the effective-date requirements that would apply if a
                    private-company or nonissuer (i.e., a company that is not a public business
                    entity [PBE]) adoption date was used for an accounting standard, and (3)
                    reversing any private-company accounting alternatives that were previously
                    elected. Entities should discuss the impact of the relevant accounting and
                    reporting considerations with their accounting advisers when appropriate. In

Deloitte,Accounting Spotlight,"August 16, 2022","Lease Accounting — Planning on Going Public? What You Need to Know About the
        Potential ASC 842 Implications",Determining the Appropriate ASC 842 Effective Date,"The effective date of ASC 842 depends on which type of entity is applying the
                    standard:  Public companies Public not-for-profit (NFP) entities All other entities Because the ASC 842 effective date for PBEs differs from that for non-PBEs,
                    entities that are going public often have questions about the implications of
                    doing so when they have not yet adopted ASC 842 or have already adopted the
                    standard by using a timeline other than that required for public companies. The effect of ASC 842 adoption on an entity that is going public depends on
                    whether the entity (1) qualifies as an emerging growth company (EGC) and has
                    elected private-company adoption dates or (2) either does not qualify as an EGC
                    or has not elected private-company adoption dates. An EGC is a category of issuer that was established in 2012
                        under the JOBS After going public, a registrant will retain its EGC status until the
                        earliest of:  The last day of the fiscal year in which its total annual gross
                                    revenues exceed $1.07 billion. The date on which it has issued more than $1 billion in
                                    nonconvertible debt securities during the previous three
                                    years. The date on which it becomes a large accelerated
                                    filer (which is an annual assessment performed on the last day
                                    of the fiscal year on the basis of public float as of the end of
                                    the second fiscal quarter). To be considered a large accelerated
                                    filer, the registrant must have filed at least one annual report
                                    and must have been subject to the requirements of Sections 13(a)
                                    and 15(d) of the 1934 Act for at least 12 months. Accordingly,
                                    the registrant generally cannot be considered a large
                                    accelerated filer for its first Form 10-K filing as a public
                                    company. The last day of the fiscal year that includes
                                    the fifth anniversary of the date of the first sale of common
                                    equity securities under an effective Securities Act of 1933
                                    registration statement for an EGC. EGCs are not required to accelerate the adoption of new accounting standards
                        and are allowed to adopt the new or revised accounting pronouncements as of
                        the effective dates for private companies or nonissuers (i.e., non-PBEs),
                        provided that such standards include a later effective date for
                        nonissuers. During an IPO, a company that qualifies as an EGC may elect
                        to use the non-PBE adoption date for ASC 842, irrespective of whether the
                        company has not yet adopted ASC 842 or has already adopted ASC 842 as of a
                        date other than the required date for PBEs. For example, if an entity that
                        qualifies as an EGC elects to defer adoption and adopted ASC 842 on January
                        1, 2020, it would not be required to push back the adoption date as part of
                        its IPO. After an IPO, such an entity may continue to defer adoption to the date for
                        nonpublic companies, but this election is only available as long as it
                        qualifies as an EGC. Questions have arisen regarding the transition
                        provisions that apply when an entity loses EGC status after the effective
                        date for PBEs but before that for non-PBEs. As discussed in paragraph
                        10230.1 of the FRM, the SEC staff generally expects an EGC that loses its
                        EGC status to comply with PBE requirements in the first filing after the
                        loss of status. Further, the staff encourages EGCs to (1) review their plans
                        for adopting accounting standards upon their loss of EGC status and
                        (2) consult with the Division of Corporation Finance if they do not believe
                        that they will be able to comply on a timely basis with the requirement to
                        reflect new accounting standards. The scenarios discussed below convey our general
                        understanding of how an EGC that elected to defer adoption would reflect the
                        new leasing standard after losing its EGC status. The general principle
                        illustrated in the two scenarios below is that the SEC will not require an
                        existing registrant that loses status to open up a previously reported
                        audited year. The scenarios are not applicable once an EGC has fully adopted
                        the ASC 842 requirements. 
                         Scenario 1 Calendar-Year-End SEC Registrant Loses Its EGC
                                                  Status on December 31, 2022 Assume that a registrant is a calendar-year-end EGC;
                                                has elected to take advantage of the extended
                                                transition provisions and adopt the new leasing
                                                standard by using private-company adoption dates;
                                                has elected the Comparatives Under 840 transition
                                                method; and loses its EGC status on December 31,
                                                2022. We believe that the registrant should adopt
                                                the new leasing standard in its next filing after
                                                losing status on the basis of the guidance in
                                                paragraph 10230.1(f) of the FRM, which states, in
                                                part:  Generally, if an EGC loses its status after it
                                                  would have had to adopt a standard absent the
                                                  extended transition, the issuer should adopt the
                                                  standard in its next filing after losing status.
                                                  However, depending on the facts and circumstances,
                                                  the staff may not object to other
                                                  alternatives. On the basis of the guidance outlined above, we
                                                believe that the SEC staff would not object if the
                                                registrant were to:  
                                                 Adopt ASC 842: For the annual period
                                                  beginning on January 1, 2022. First present the application of ASC 842 in
                                                  its: 2022 annual financial statements included in
                                                  its 2022 Form 10-K. Present the application of ASC 842 in its
                                                  selected quarterly financial data (SEC Regulation
                                                  S-K, Item 302(a)) for its: 2022 quarterly periods in its 2022 Form 10-K.
                                                  Further, we believe that the registrant should
                                                  provide clear and transparent disclosures that the
                                                  quarterly financial data presented in its 2022
                                                  Form 10-K do not mirror the information in its
                                                  2022 Forms 10-Q for the current year. Note that while the requirement in Item 302(a)
                                                  only applies when a material retrospective change
                                                  has occurred, the SEC clarified that a
                                                  registrant’s loss of EGC status would represent a
                                                  retrospective change whose materiality would need
                                                  to be evaluated because the registrant would adopt
                                                  ASC 842 in the Form 10-K for “both the full fiscal
                                                  year and interim periods within that fiscal year.”
                                                  See footnote 70 of SEC Final Rule No. 33-10890 for
                                                  more information. Present the application of
                                                  ASC 842 in its quarterly interim financial
                                                  statements for its: 2022 comparable quarterly
                                                  periods presented in Forms 10-Q in 2023. 
                         Scenario 2 Calendar-Year-End SEC Registrant Qualifies as an
                                                  EGC on or After December 31, 2022 Assume the same facts as in Scenario 1 except that
                                                the registrant qualifies as an EGC through the end
                                                of the adoption date required for a non-PBE (i.e.,
                                                through December 31, 2022) or later. We believe
                                                that, in such circumstances, the registrant could:  
                                                 Adopt ASC 842: For the annual period
                                                  beginning on January 1, 2022. First present the application of ASC 842 in
                                                  its: 2022 annual financial statements included in
                                                  its 2022 Form 10-K. Present the application of
                                                  ASC 842 in its quarterly interim financial
                                                  statements for its: 2023 quarterly periods presented in Forms 10-Q
                                                  in 2023. The registrant is encouraged, but not
                                                  required, to present the 2022 comparable quarters
                                                  under ASC 842 in its Forms 10-Q in 2023. If the
                                                  registrant does not present the comparable
                                                  quarters under the new standard, the SEC staff
                                                  would expect the registrant to provide clear and
                                                  transparent disclosures that the prior-period
                                                  information is presented on a basis different from
                                                  that of the current year. Item 302(a) requires registrants to provide selected
                                                quarterly financial data when a material
                                                retrospective change has occurred. However, the SEC
                                                clarified that if a registrant qualifies as an EGC
                                                and adopts ASC 842 for the first time in its annual
                                                report on Form 10-K, the change would not be viewed
                                                as retrospective when the registrant provides
                                                disclosures in accordance with Item 302(a) because
                                                an EGC is permitted to use non-PBE adoption dates
                                                and ASC 842 permits non-PBEs to first adopt the new
                                                leasing standard in an annual period rather than an
                                                interim period. As illustrated in the scenarios above, the loss of EGC status in 2022 will
                        largely affect whether the adoption of ASC 842 needs to be reflected in the
                        historical quarterly periods for 2022. At the July 29, 2020, CAQ SEC Regulations Committee Meeting, the SEC staff
                        indicated that entities, other than EGCs, that undertake an IPO must apply
                        the public-entity effective date and adoption requirements for all periods
                        presented in the financial statements as well as for all accounting
                        standards, including ASC 842. Therefore, a non-PBE that does not qualify as
                        an EGC may be required to retrospectively change and accelerate its ASC 842
                        adoption date to that for PBEs, irrespective of whether the entity has
                        already early adopted ASC 842 as a private company or was expecting to adopt
                        the standard in the near term. The entity thus may need to use the judgments
                        and assumptions that were in place at that time to push back the adoption
                        date to the PBE effective date. For example, the entity will need to measure
                        its leases by using the ASC 842 transition guidance as of the PBE effective
                        date on the basis of the remaining lease payments, lease term, and discount
                        rate that would have been in place at that time. Then, from that point
                        forward, the entity will apply the ASC 842 guidance to all leases for which
                        the entity made the transition to ASC 842 as of the application date and all
                        new leases executed or modified after the application date. 
                         Adoption Timeline Non-EGC private entities may want to consider how their timeline for
                                a potential IPO may affect their plans related to adopting ASC 842
                                as well as any other new accounting standards. For example, a
                                non-EGC calendar-year-end private entity that has elected to file an
                                IPO after adopting ASC 842 (and after the required adoption date for
                                PBEs) will be required to retrospectively adjust its financial
                                statements and accelerate its adoption date to the PBE effective
                                date. Accordingly, a non-EGC private entity that expects to
                                undertake an IPO may consider early adoption on the basis of PBE
                                adoption dates. 
                         Scenario 1 Calendar-Year-End Private Company That Had
                                                   Assume that Company A, a calendar-year-end private
                                                company that has not yet adopted ASC 842, undertakes
                                                an IPO in August 2022. Further assume that A does
                                                not qualify as an EGC and will be required to
                                                include annual financial statements for the years
                                                ended December 31, 2019, 2020, and 2021, in its Form
                                                S-1 registration statement filed with the SEC. We believe that in such a scenario,
                                                A would be required to push back its ASC 842
                                                adoption to January 1, 2019 (i.e., the effective
                                                date for PBEs). 
                         Scenario 2 Calendar-Year-End Private Company That Had Already
                                                  Adopted ASC 842 Initiates an IPO in March
                                                2023 Assume that Company A, a calendar-year-end private
                                                company that has already adopted ASC 842 on January
                                                1, 2022, undertakes an IPO in March 2023. Further
                                                assume that A does not qualify as an EGC and will be
                                                required to include annual financial statements for
                                                the years ended December 31, 2020, 2021, and 2022,
                                                in its Form S-1 registration statement filed with
                                                the SEC. We believe that in such a scenario
                                                and in a manner similar to that in Scenario 1, A
                                                would be required to push back its ASC 842 adoption
                                                to January 1, 2019 (i.e., the effective date for
                                                PBEs). Therefore, A will need to retrospectively
                                                adjust its financial statements to reflect the
                                                impact of ASC 842 as if it were adopted on January
                                                1, 2019; any leasing activity that occurred from
                                                that point forward would be subject to the ASC 842
                                                requirements. Note that this principle will hold true irrespective
                                                of when the private company undertakes its IPO. For
                                                example, to the extent that the difference will be
                                                material, when a calendar-year-end private company
                                                that does not qualify as an EGC decides to initiate
                                                an IPO in 2028, it will need to push back its
                                                adoption date to January 1, 2019, with the balances
                                                rolled forward to the periods included in the
                                                registration statement."

        Potential ASC 842 Implications","ASC 842 IPO Considerations for an EGC That Elected to Use Private-Company
                Adoption Dates","An EGC is a category of issuer that was established in 2012
                        under the JOBS After going public, a registrant will retain its EGC status until the
                        earliest of:  The last day of the fiscal year in which its total annual gross
                                    revenues exceed $1.07 billion. The date on which it has issued more than $1 billion in
                                    nonconvertible debt securities during the previous three
                                    years. The date on which it becomes a large accelerated
                                    filer (which is an annual assessment performed on the last day
                                    of the fiscal year on the basis of public float as of the end of
                                    the second fiscal quarter). To be considered a large accelerated
                                    filer, the registrant must have filed at least one annual report
                                    and must have been subject to the requirements of Sections 13(a)
                                    and 15(d) of the 1934 Act for at least 12 months. Accordingly,
                                    the registrant generally cannot be considered a large
                                    accelerated filer for its first Form 10-K filing as a public
                                    company. The last day of the fiscal year that includes
                                    the fifth anniversary of the date of the first sale of common
                                    equity securities under an effective Securities Act of 1933
                                    registration statement for an EGC. EGCs are not required to accelerate the adoption of new accounting standards
                        and are allowed to adopt the new or revised accounting pronouncements as of
                        the effective dates for private companies or nonissuers (i.e., non-PBEs),
                        provided that such standards include a later effective date for
                        nonissuers. During an IPO, a company that qualifies as an EGC may elect
                        to use the non-PBE adoption date for ASC 842, irrespective of whether the
                        company has not yet adopted ASC 842 or has already adopted ASC 842 as of a
                        date other than the required date for PBEs. For example, if an entity that
                        qualifies as an EGC elects to defer adoption and adopted ASC 842 on January
                        1, 2020, it would not be required to push back the adoption date as part of
                        its IPO. After an IPO, such an entity may continue to defer adoption to the date for
                        nonpublic companies, but this election is only available as long as it
                        qualifies as an EGC. Questions have arisen regarding the transition
                        provisions that apply when an entity loses EGC status after the effective
                        date for PBEs but before that for non-PBEs. As discussed in paragraph
                        10230.1 of the FRM, the SEC staff generally expects an EGC that loses its
                        EGC status to comply with PBE requirements in the first filing after the
                        loss of status. Further, the staff encourages EGCs to (1) review their plans
                        for adopting accounting standards upon their loss of EGC status and
                        (2) consult with the Division of Corporation Finance if they do not believe
                        that they will be able to comply on a timely basis with the requirement to
                        reflect new accounting standards. The scenarios discussed below convey our general
                        understanding of how an EGC that elected to defer adoption would reflect the
                        new leasing standard after losing its EGC status. The general principle
                        illustrated in the two scenarios below is that the SEC will not require an
                        existing registrant that loses status to open up a previously reported
                        audited year. The scenarios are not applicable once an EGC has fully adopted
                        the ASC 842 requirements. 
                         Scenario 1 Calendar-Year-End SEC Registrant Loses Its EGC
                                                  Status on December 31, 2022 Assume that a registrant is a calendar-year-end EGC;
                                                has elected to take advantage of the extended
                                                transition provisions and adopt the new leasing
                                                standard by using private-company adoption dates;
                                                has elected the Comparatives Under 840 transition
                                                method; and loses its EGC status on December 31,
                                                2022. We believe that the registrant should adopt
                                                the new leasing standard in its next filing after
                                                losing status on the basis of the guidance in
                                                paragraph 10230.1(f) of the FRM, which states, in
                                                part:  Generally, if an EGC loses its status after it
                                                  would have had to adopt a standard absent the
                                                  extended transition, the issuer should adopt the
                                                  standard in its next filing after losing status.
                                                  However, depending on the facts and circumstances,
                                                  the staff may not object to other
                                                  alternatives. On the basis of the guidance outlined above, we
                                                believe that the SEC staff would not object if the
                                                registrant were to:  
                                                 Adopt ASC 842: For the annual period
                                                  beginning on January 1, 2022. First present the application of ASC 842 in
                                                  its: 2022 annual financial statements included in
                                                  its 2022 Form 10-K. Present the application of ASC 842 in its
                                                  selected quarterly financial data (SEC Regulation
                                                  S-K, Item 302(a)) for its: 2022 quarterly periods in its 2022 Form 10-K.
                                                  Further, we believe that the registrant should
                                                  provide clear and transparent disclosures that the
                                                  quarterly financial data presented in its 2022
                                                  Form 10-K do not mirror the information in its
                                                  2022 Forms 10-Q for the current year. Note that while the requirement in Item 302(a)
                                                  only applies when a material retrospective change
                                                  has occurred, the SEC clarified that a
                                                  registrant’s loss of EGC status would represent a
                                                  retrospective change whose materiality would need
                                                  to be evaluated because the registrant would adopt
                                                  ASC 842 in the Form 10-K for “both the full fiscal
                                                  year and interim periods within that fiscal year.”
                                                  See footnote 70 of SEC Final Rule No. 33-10890 for
                                                  more information. Present the application of
                                                  ASC 842 in its quarterly interim financial
                                                  statements for its: 2022 comparable quarterly
                                                  periods presented in Forms 10-Q in 2023. 
                         Scenario 2 Calendar-Year-End SEC Registrant Qualifies as an
                                                  EGC on or After December 31, 2022 Assume the same facts as in Scenario 1 except that
                                                the registrant qualifies as an EGC through the end
                                                of the adoption date required for a non-PBE (i.e.,
                                                through December 31, 2022) or later. We believe
                                                that, in such circumstances, the registrant could:  
                                                 Adopt ASC 842: For the annual period
                                                  beginning on January 1, 2022. First present the application of ASC 842 in
                                                  its: 2022 annual financial statements included in
                                                  its 2022 Form 10-K. Present the application of
                                                  ASC 842 in its quarterly interim financial
                                                  statements for its: 2023 quarterly periods presented in Forms 10-Q
                                                  in 2023. The registrant is encouraged, but not
                                                  required, to present the 2022 comparable quarters
                                                  under ASC 842 in its Forms 10-Q in 2023. If the
                                                  registrant does not present the comparable
                                                  quarters under the new standard, the SEC staff
                                                  would expect the registrant to provide clear and
                                                  transparent disclosures that the prior-period
                                                  information is presented on a basis different from
                                                  that of the current year. Item 302(a) requires registrants to provide selected
                                                quarterly financial data when a material
                                                retrospective change has occurred. However, the SEC
                                                clarified that if a registrant qualifies as an EGC
                                                and adopts ASC 842 for the first time in its annual
                                                report on Form 10-K, the change would not be viewed
                                                as retrospective when the registrant provides
                                                disclosures in accordance with Item 302(a) because
                                                an EGC is permitted to use non-PBE adoption dates
                                                and ASC 842 permits non-PBEs to first adopt the new
                                                leasing standard in an annual period rather than an
                                                interim period. As illustrated in the scenarios above, the loss of EGC status in 2022 will
                        largely affect whether the adoption of ASC 842 needs to be reflected in the
                        historical quarterly periods for 2022."
Deloitte,Accounting Spotlight,"August 16, 2022","Lease Accounting — Planning on Going Public? What You Need to Know About the
        Potential ASC 842 Implications",ASC 842 IPO Considerations for an Entity That Does Not Qualify as an EGC,"At the July 29, 2020, CAQ SEC Regulations Committee Meeting, the SEC staff
                        indicated that entities, other than EGCs, that undertake an IPO must apply
                        the public-entity effective date and adoption requirements for all periods
                        presented in the financial statements as well as for all accounting
                        standards, including ASC 842. Therefore, a non-PBE that does not qualify as
                        an EGC may be required to retrospectively change and accelerate its ASC 842
                        adoption date to that for PBEs, irrespective of whether the entity has
                        already early adopted ASC 842 as a private company or was expecting to adopt
                        the standard in the near term. The entity thus may need to use the judgments
                        and assumptions that were in place at that time to push back the adoption
                        date to the PBE effective date. For example, the entity will need to measure
                        its leases by using the ASC 842 transition guidance as of the PBE effective
                        date on the basis of the remaining lease payments, lease term, and discount
                        rate that would have been in place at that time. Then, from that point
                        forward, the entity will apply the ASC 842 guidance to all leases for which
                        the entity made the transition to ASC 842 as of the application date and all
                        new leases executed or modified after the application date. 
                         Adoption Timeline Non-EGC private entities may want to consider how their timeline for
                                a potential IPO may affect their plans related to adopting ASC 842
                                as well as any other new accounting standards. For example, a
                                non-EGC calendar-year-end private entity that has elected to file an
                                IPO after adopting ASC 842 (and after the required adoption date for
                                PBEs) will be required to retrospectively adjust its financial
                                statements and accelerate its adoption date to the PBE effective
                                date. Accordingly, a non-EGC private entity that expects to
                                undertake an IPO may consider early adoption on the basis of PBE
                                adoption dates. 
                         Scenario 1 Calendar-Year-End Private Company That Had
                                                   Assume that Company A, a calendar-year-end private
                                                company that has not yet adopted ASC 842, undertakes
                                                an IPO in August 2022. Further assume that A does
                                                not qualify as an EGC and will be required to
                                                include annual financial statements for the years
                                                ended December 31, 2019, 2020, and 2021, in its Form
                                                S-1 registration statement filed with the SEC. We believe that in such a scenario,
                                                A would be required to push back its ASC 842
                                                adoption to January 1, 2019 (i.e., the effective
                                                date for PBEs). 
                         Scenario 2 Calendar-Year-End Private Company That Had Already
                                                  Adopted ASC 842 Initiates an IPO in March
                                                2023 Assume that Company A, a calendar-year-end private
                                                company that has already adopted ASC 842 on January
                                                1, 2022, undertakes an IPO in March 2023. Further
                                                assume that A does not qualify as an EGC and will be
                                                required to include annual financial statements for
                                                the years ended December 31, 2020, 2021, and 2022,
                                                in its Form S-1 registration statement filed with
                                                the SEC. We believe that in such a scenario
                                                and in a manner similar to that in Scenario 1, A
                                                would be required to push back its ASC 842 adoption
                                                to January 1, 2019 (i.e., the effective date for
                                                PBEs). Therefore, A will need to retrospectively
                                                adjust its financial statements to reflect the
                                                impact of ASC 842 as if it were adopted on January
                                                1, 2019; any leasing activity that occurred from
                                                that point forward would be subject to the ASC 842
                                                requirements. Note that this principle will hold true irrespective
                                                of when the private company undertakes its IPO. For
                                                example, to the extent that the difference will be
                                                material, when a calendar-year-end private company
                                                that does not qualify as an EGC decides to initiate
                                                an IPO in 2028, it will need to push back its
                                                adoption date to January 1, 2019, with the balances
                                                rolled forward to the periods included in the
                                                registration statement."
Deloitte,Accounting Spotlight,"August 16, 2022","Lease Accounting — Planning on Going Public? What You Need to Know About the
        Potential ASC 842 Implications",Establishing the Discount Rate Used to Measure a Lease,"Entities that are going public often have questions about the
                    impact of discount rates when they have either not yet adopted or have already
                    adopted ASC 842. Specifically, such entities have asked whether they would be
                    permitted to use or continue to use the private-company risk-free rate
                    alternative if they qualify as an EGC. The short answer is no; PBEs are not
                    permitted to use any private-company accounting alternatives when preparing
                    their financial statements. Therefore,  It can be difficult for a company that is going public to determine the IBR when
                    it lacks easy access to the information it needs to establish an appropriate
                    IBR. More significant challenges may include the following:  Re-creating the assumptions that would be in place if the adoption
                                must be pushed back. Lack of history of creditworthiness and lack of industry-adopted
                                tools related to quantitatively deriving a synthetic credit
                                rating. Limited borrowings for the company. Access to relevant yield market data (e.g., Bloomberg, Capital
                                IQ). Credit quality that is artificially inflated because of lack of
                                debt. Limited or private borrowings in the form of revolvers, asset-based
                                loans, or other debt facilities deemed to be overcollateralized. Lack of centralized treasury function that also affects foreign
                                subsidiary leases. In addition to these challenges, companies often have limited
                    “in house” experience in capital markets, limiting their ability to develop the
                    IBR themselves. Accordingly, companies frequently need to engage third-party
                    valuation specialists to assist in this effort. The sections below address two of the more challenging aspects of establishing
                    the discount rate used to measure a lease. There are certain accounting alternatives for private
                        companies under U.S. GAAP, one of which is the use of a risk-free rate to
                        classify and measure leases under ASC 842. Some companies that are going
                        public may have already elected to use a risk-free rate when adopting ASC
                        842 to reduce some of the cost and complexity of applying the requirements.
                        While the use of a risk-free rate may be appropriate for lessees that are
                        not PBEs, public companies cannot employ this rate since the use of
                        private-company accounting alternatives is not permitted for PBEs.
                        Therefore, once a company (even if it qualifies as an EGC) is considered a
                        PBE, it is  
                         Use of a Risk-Free Rate When There Is a Plan to Go
                                    Public To avoid having to reverse the risk-free rate election or any other
                                private-company alternative accounting policies, an entity should
                                avoid using such alternatives if it expects that it may undergo an
                                IPO or that its financial statements may be included in another
                                company’s IPO in the future. Accordingly, such an entity will not
                                need to retrospectively undo all of these elections as part of the
                                IPO process. Lessors are required to use the rate implicit in the lease
                        (RIIL). Lessees are similarly required to use the RIIL if it can be readily
                        determined. In determining the RIIL, a lessee needs to know several
                        assumptions  While there is no prescribed approach to estimating a company-specific IBR,
                        there are a number of factors to consider. The entity should analyze its
                        credit quality to form a basis for developing appropriate borrowing rates.
                        In addition, the entity should consider the fact that the rates used must
                        reflect a secured, or collateralized, cost of borrowing. For most entities,
                        a curve reflecting secured borrowing rates for varying tenors will need to
                        be developed so that suitable rates can be applied to leases with different
                        remaining lease terms. ASC 842 specifies that the rate used should reflect a
                        collateralized borrowing that covers the lease payments over the lease term.
                        Accordingly, one common approach — often referred to as the notching
                        approach — would be to develop an interest rate curve that takes into
                        account the entity’s credit quality, with an additional adjustment to
                        reflect the impact of collateral. Subsidiaries may not necessarily default to using rates that reflect their
                        parents’ credit standing. Generally speaking, a subsidiary should only take
                        its parent’s credit into account if the parent guarantees the lease or the
                        lessor otherwise had reason to consider the parent’s credit when negotiating
                        the lease. Accordingly, the organizational structure may necessitate
                        separate consideration of the credit quality of certain subsidiaries in
                        addition to that of the parent. Further, if a company is party to leases
                        denominated in foreign currencies, the company will need to consider making
                        additional adjustments to the established base rates to reflect any
                        applicable currency or political risks in each jurisdiction. Multinational
                        companies are likely to have various IBR curves that reflect different
                        combinations of credit, currency, and political risks to be applied to
                        leases on the basis of their key characteristics. An entity will need to use judgment and consider multiple factors to
                        determine an appropriate IBR. Some entities will start with a base rate that
                        reflects general factors (e.g., overall economic conditions, currency
                        volatility, and the broad interest rate environment for various types of
                        securities and terms) and then will adjust for entity-specific factors
                        (e.g., credit risk). Other entities may begin with bond rates that already
                        incorporate a credit factor. In all cases, characteristics like lease
                        term/tenor, level of indebtedness, payment structure and timing, and
                        parent/subsidiary structure should be considered. Entities need to apply an
                        adjustment for full collateralization that reflects the liquidity of the
                        collateral chosen (e.g., the more liquid the collateral, the larger the
                        potential adjustment to the rate). In this respect, the assumed collateral

                        significantly from one business to the next, companies that have the right

                        public may have already elected to use a risk-free rate when adopting ASC
                        842 to reduce some of the cost and complexity of applying the requirements.
                        While the use of a risk-free rate may be appropriate for lessees that are
                        not PBEs, public companies cannot employ this rate since the use of

Deloitte,Accounting Spotlight,"October 7, 2022",Accounting and Reporting Considerations for Environmental Credits,Background,"An increasing number of entities in different sectors and
                    industries aim to reduce global greenhouse-gas (GHG) emissions. While many are
                    taking steps to reduce their own carbon emissions, these efforts may not be
                    sufficient to achieve required or voluntary emission commitments.  Environmental credits can help entities accomplish their carbon emission
                    reduction targets and goals. The popularity of such credits has grown; however,
                    questions have emerged regarding the accounting and reporting for them since the
                    treatment of environmental credits is not explicitly addressed in U.S. GAAP. The

Deloitte,Accounting Spotlight,"January 30, 2023","Considerations for Commercial Entities Implementing the Current Expected
        Credit Loss Standard in 2023",Background,"The historical approach used to recognize impairment losses on financial assets has
                long been identified as a major weakness in U.S. GAAP, resulting in delayed
                recognition of such losses and leading to increased scrutiny. Accordingly, in 2016,
                the FASB issued  ASU 2016-13 changes the impairment model for financial instruments measured at
                amortized cost by requiring these assets to be measured and presented at the net
                amount expected to be collected over the financial asset’s lifetime, which may
                accelerate the recording of losses. Before the adoption of the CECL standard,
                impairments were not recorded until an incurred loss was probable. However, under
                the CECL model, an entity should recognize an allowance that reflects its estimate
                of lifetime expected credit losses instead of recording an allowance that is limited
                to losses that have been incurred. We would not expect many commercial entities that do not engage in significant
                lending activities to be significantly affected by the CECL standard. However, the

        Potential ASC 842 Implications",Considerations Related to Determining the IBR,"Lessors are required to use the rate implicit in the lease
                        (RIIL). Lessees are similarly required to use the RIIL if it can be readily
                        determined. In determining the RIIL, a lessee needs to know several
                        assumptions  While there is no prescribed approach to estimating a company-specific IBR,
                        there are a number of factors to consider. The entity should analyze its
                        credit quality to form a basis for developing appropriate borrowing rates.
                        In addition, the entity should consider the fact that the rates used must
                        reflect a secured, or collateralized, cost of borrowing. For most entities,
                        a curve reflecting secured borrowing rates for varying tenors will need to
                        be developed so that suitable rates can be applied to leases with different
                        remaining lease terms. ASC 842 specifies that the rate used should reflect a
                        collateralized borrowing that covers the lease payments over the lease term.
                        Accordingly, one common approach — often referred to as the notching
                        approach — would be to develop an interest rate curve that takes into
                        account the entity’s credit quality, with an additional adjustment to
                        reflect the impact of collateral. Subsidiaries may not necessarily default to using rates that reflect their
                        parents’ credit standing. Generally speaking, a subsidiary should only take
                        its parent’s credit into account if the parent guarantees the lease or the
                        lessor otherwise had reason to consider the parent’s credit when negotiating
                        the lease. Accordingly, the organizational structure may necessitate
                        separate consideration of the credit quality of certain subsidiaries in
                        addition to that of the parent. Further, if a company is party to leases
                        denominated in foreign currencies, the company will need to consider making
                        additional adjustments to the established base rates to reflect any
                        applicable currency or political risks in each jurisdiction. Multinational

Deloitte,Accounting Spotlight,"October 7, 2022",Accounting and Reporting Considerations for Environmental Credits,What Are Environmental Credits?,"Within this publication, the term “environmental credits”
                    encompasses products such as carbon credits (both allowances and offsets) as
                    well as renewable energy certificates (RECs) and other climate- or
                    emission-related credits. In the most basic sense, a carbon credit is a market-based or legal instrument
                    that represents the ownership of one metric ton of carbon dioxide equivalent
                    (MTCO2e) that can be held, sold, or retired to meet a mandatory emissions cap or
                    a voluntary emissions reduction target. Carbon credits are primarily
                    distinguished on the basis of whether they are allowances or offsets.  Allowances (also known as “permits”) are initially issued by
                    regulatory agencies in carbon compliance programs (e.g., cap-and-trade programs
                    or emissions trading schemes). One allowance gives the holder the legal right to
                    emit one MTCO2e. Typically, a carbon compliance program establishes a total
                    volume of emissions permitted by all of its regulated entities in a given year
                    and a corresponding volume of allowances. Regulating agencies then allocate
                    (free of charge) or auction off allowances to the regulated entities. If an
                    entity wishes to emit more or less MTCO2e, it can purchase allowances from, or
                    sell them to, other entities. These allowances are often also referred to as
                    “carbon credits” since each allowance represents a tradeable MTCO2e. Offsets are generated from projects in which the objective is to
                    produce and sell verified carbon credits for every MTCO2e reduced, avoided, or
                    removed from the atmosphere by the projects. Carbon credits from these projects
                    are ultimately used by the final entity that purchases and retires the credits
                    to “offset” its emissions, so they are often called “carbon offsets.” “Voluntary
                    carbon offsets” are used to help meet an entity’s voluntary emissions reduction
                    targets to compensate for emissions that it has not yet been able to abate. In addition to carbon credits, numerous other “credits” exist.
                    One of the more common examples is a REC, which is issued when one megawatt-hour
                    (MWh) of electricity is generated and delivered to the electricity grid from a
                    renewable energy resource. See further discussion of RECs in the next section. "
Deloitte,Accounting Spotlight,"January 30, 2023","Considerations for Commercial Entities Implementing the Current Expected
        Credit Loss Standard in 2023",Leveraging Existing Processes,"The CECL standard does not prescribe any single method for determining expected
                    credit losses. Consequently, entities have latitude to develop processes that
                    are appropriate for the credit risk (and financial statement misstatement risk)
                    associated with assets within the scope of the CECL model. We would expect that
                    most entities will be able to leverage existing credit impairment models to
                    determine expected credit losses. However, there are certain aspects of the CECL
                    standard that may require an entity to change existing practices or scrutinize
                    historical data to isolate relevant information. In addition, because an entity
                    will need to establish a reserve for its lifetime expected credit losses by
                    using reasonable and supportable forecasts, the entity may have to put processes
                    in place to incorporate forward-looking assumptions into its reserve method. Under the CECL model, entities are required to pool their financial
                        instruments and other in-scope assets when the assets have similar risk
                        characteristics. That is, the guidance does not permit an entity to measure
                        the expected credit losses on a financial asset individually unless the
                        asset has a unique risk profile that does not align with any of the other
                        assets held by the entity. ASC 326-20-30-2 states: It is important for an entity to understand how credit loss reserves have
                        historically been established so that it can evaluate the likely impact of
                        the CECL model on its existing processes. Relevant considerations include
                        the following: These considerations are
                        illustrated in the example below. 
                         Example Entity X sells goods to various retailers, which are
                                                provided with 30-day payment terms. The retailers
                                                are predominantly located in either of two
                                                geographic areas (Geography A and Geography B).
                                                Entity X has historically established its reserve
                                                for uncollectible accounts receivable by using a
                                                single aging analysis based on historical write-offs
                                                and adjustments, reserving the following: Most of X’s historical write-offs have been related
                                                to its smaller customers, and its write-off history
                                                in Geography A has been 50 percent greater than in
                                                Geography B. In addition, X routinely grants credit
                                                to customers even if they have invoices outstanding
                                                for more than 60 days. Accordingly, it is common for
                                                X to have customers with receivable balances in the
                                                current, 1–30 days past due, and 31–60 days past due
                                                aging buckets. When adopting the CECL standard, X may need to
                                                disaggregate its receivable balance into separate
                                                pools to estimate expected credit losses. This is
                                                because its historical loss information suggests
                                                that (1) the credit risk of customers in Geography A
                                                is different from that of customers in Geography B
                                                and (2) the credit risk of large customers is
                                                different from that of small customers. In addition,
                                                because a single customer may have outstanding
                                                invoice balances that span multiple aging buckets
                                                (each reserved at a different percentage), X may
                                                need to support why its existing method
                                                appropriately calculates lifetime expected credit
                                                losses for each pool. This is because invoices with
                                                the same customer or pool of customers in different
                                                aging buckets may have the same lifetime collection
                                                risk (since they are due from the same customer or
                                                pool of customers), but each invoice is being
                                                reserved at a different amount under the existing
                                                method. Further, it is likely that under the CECL
                                                model, it will no longer be appropriate to reserve 0
                                                percent for current receivables since it would be
                                                difficult for an entity to support an assertion that
                                                it expects to collect 100 percent of the current
                                                receivables balance. In applying the CECL model, X may also need to
                                                develop a process and related controls for
                                                monitoring economic conditions in Geography A and
                                                Geography B so that it can adjust its historical
                                                loss information in response to changes in market
                                                conditions that could affect expected loss
                                                rates. While commercial entities should be able to leverage existing methods when
                        developing expected loss reserves, some changes may be required to align
                        those methods with the CECL model. Before adoption of the CECL model, entities most likely used some form of
                        historical collection data to establish a historical loss rate and calculate
                        their reserve for uncollectible accounts related to their trade receivables
                        balance. ASC 326-20-30-8 states that “[h]istorical credit loss experience of
                        financial assets with similar risk characteristics generally provides a
                        basis for an entity’s assessment of expected credit losses.” In accordance
                        with ASC 326-20-30-9, an entity is required to consider whether the
                        historical loss rates differ from what is currently expected over the life
                        of the trade receivables (on the basis of current conditions and reasonable
                        and supportable forecasts about the future); if so, the entity should make
                        appropriate adjustments to the historical loss data. These adjustments can
                        be qualitative and should reflect changes in relevant conditions (internal
                        and external) that suggest that the historical loss information may not
                        adequately predict expected losses. If the life of a receivable is
                        relatively short, an entity may need to make only minimal adjustments to the
                        historical loss data to estimate expected credit losses. Although it may be appropriate for an entity to use historical loss
                        information to calculate a reserve for uncollectible accounts, historical
                        loss or write-off information may include invoice or receivable adjustments
                        that are not credit-related. For example, an entity’s historical write-off
                        data may include items such as those related to price concessions, volume or
                        other rebates, credit memos for returned items, credit card charge-offs, and
                        disputed balances. While all of these items could be appropriate adjustments
                        to the recorded receivables balance (i.e., adjustments that reflect amounts
                        the entity is unable to collect on the recorded receivable balance), they
                        are most likely not credit-related and could often affect the amount of
                        revenue recognized for the transaction (i.e., they may be forms of variable
                        consideration under ASC 606). Using historical loss data that include
                        write-offs unrelated to credit events could overstate the reserve recorded
                        for expected credit losses. Entities will need to ensure that they have an appropriate understanding of
                        the transactions included in the historical data they are using to calculate
                        the allowance for expected credit losses. This may be more straightforward
                        for entities with systems in which there is an identifier for each type of
                        credit loss recorded. However, many smaller entities may not have systems
                        with such capabilities. These entities might need to establish a separate
                        process to isolate credit losses in the historical data they use to estimate
                        expected credit losses."
Deloitte,Accounting Spotlight,"August 16, 2022","Lease Accounting — Planning on Going Public? What You Need to Know About the
        Potential ASC 842 Implications",Accounting for Leases Recognized as Part of a SPAC Transaction,"One of the methods of going public is executing a merger with a SPAC. A SPAC is a
                    newly formed company that raises cash in an IPO and uses that cash or the equity
                    of the SPAC, or both, to fund the acquisition of a target. After a SPAC IPO, the
                    SPAC’s management looks to complete an acquisition of a target within the period
                    specified in its governing documents (e.g., 24 months). In many cases, the SPAC
                    and target may need to secure additional financing to facilitate the
                    transaction. For example, they may consider funding through a private investment
                    in public equity (PIPE), which will generally close contemporaneously with the
                    consummation of the transaction. If an acquisition cannot be completed within
                    the required time frame, the cash raised by the SPAC in the IPO must be returned
                    to the investors and the SPAC is dissolved (unless the SPAC extends its timeline
                    via a proxy process). See Deloitte’s October 2, 2020 (updated April 11, 2022),
                         Since a SPAC IPO depends on the acquisition of a target entity, this acquisition
                    may be subject to the guidance in ASC 805. In a SPAC transaction, it is
                    necessary to determine which entity is the accounting acquirer and which is the
                    accounting acquiree. The discussion below only applies to situations in which
                    the SPAC is the accounting acquirer and the target operating company is the
                    accounting acquiree. Leases (including contracts that contain a lease) acquired in a business
                    combination may result in the recognition of various assets or liabilities,
                    depending on the classification of the lease and whether the acquiree is the
                    lessee or the lessor under the lease contract. In addition, ASC 805 includes
                    certain requirements related to accounting for leases and lease-related
                    balances. See Deloitte’s Roadmap  As indicated in ASC 842-10-55-11, an acquirer in a business combination
                        should retain the acquiree’s classification of its leases unless “there is a
                        lease modification and that modification is not accounted for as a separate
                        contract.” The ASC master glossary defines a lease modification as follows:  A change to the terms and conditions of a contract  As part of a business combination, a lease might be changed in ways that do
                        not qualify as a lease modification. For example, a lease may be changed to
                        reflect the new owner of the acquiree. Such a change in the name of one of
                        the parties identified in the contract would not qualify as a lease
                        modification without a change in the scope of or consideration for the
                        lease. An entity must carefully consider whether the lease has been modified,
                        thereby resulting in a reassessment of the lease classification. Leases acquired as part of a business combination are
                        accounted for similarly to new leases, with one exception: lease
                        classification is not reassessed for leases acquired in a business
                        combination (see above). As a result, in a manner similar to the accounting
                        for new leases, the acquirer must determine the lease term as of the
                        acquisition date. Accordingly, whether a renewal period is factored into a
                        lease term depends on whether the acquirer concludes that it is reasonably
                        certain that the renewal option will be exercised. Similarly, whether the
                        period after a termination option is factored into the lease term depends on
                        whether it is reasonably certain that the termination option will not be
                        exercised. Further, the acquirer must assess whether it is reasonably
                        certain that it will exercise or not exercise any available purchase option.
                        An acquirer’s assessment of whether it will be reasonably certain to
                        exercise a renewal, termination, or purchase option is made as of the
                        acquisition date. This assessment is based on the acquirer’s own evaluation
                        and is not affected by what the acquiree assumed as of the original lease
                        commencement date. As a reminder, if the acquiree (at lease commencement) and the acquirer (on
                        the acquisition date) reach different conclusions about the likelihood of
                        exercising an option to extend the lease term, terminate the lease, or
                        purchase the underlying asset, the classification of the acquired lease does
                        not change unless the lease is modified and the modification is not
                        accounted for as a separate contract. Assets or liabilities for prepaid or accrued rent, as well as unamortized
                        lease incentives and initial direct costs, are not recognized under ASC 805
                        regardless of whether the acquiree is the lessee or the lessor in a lease.
                        This notion is consistent with paragraph BC415 of ASU 2016-02, The acquiree’s right-of-use asset should be measured at the amount of
                                the lease liability, adjusted for any off-market terms (that is,
                                favorable or unfavorable terms) present in the lease. Prepaid or
                                accrued rent should not be recognized [in a business combination]                                 because such amounts do not meet the definition of an asset or a                                 liability in Concepts Statement 6 under the acquisition method of
                                Topic 805, Business Combinations. Instead, the remaining lease
                                payments required under the terms of the lease are considered in
                                evaluating whether the terms of the lease are favorable or
                                unfavorable at the acquisition date. Although the prepaid and deferred amounts are not recognized for an acquired
                        lease, the remaining lease payments may be more or less than they would be
                        for a new lease of the property with the same remaining term. As a result,
                        the lease may be above or below market as of the acquisition date, which
                        will affect the required recognition of amounts related to any favorable or
                        unfavorable terms. When the acquiree is a lessee, certain assets and
                        liabilities may result from the initial measurement of the acquired leases.
                        Right-of-use (ROU) assets and lease liabilities arising from an acquiree’s
                        operating or finance leases are exceptions to ASC 805’s recognition and fair
                        value measurement principles. Instead, ROU assets and lease liabilities are
                        recognized and measured in accordance with ASC 842, though the acquirer
                        would adjust the measurement of the ROU asset for acquired leases for any
                        favorable or unfavorable terms. In addition, an acquirer may need to
                        recognize and measure at fair value certain lease-related intangible assets
                        or liabilities. For example, the acquirer may need to recognize an
                        intangible asset for an in-place lease; such balances would be recognized
                        separately in the financial statements and would not be combined with other
                        lease-related assets or liabilities (e.g., they would not be combined with
                        lessee ROU assets). In addition, the acquirer may need to recognize acquired
                        leasehold improvements that were previously owned by the acquiree; these
                        assets would be recognized at their acquisition-date fair value. Moreover, the acquirer may elect — as an accounting policy election by class
                        of underlying asset and for all of the entity’s acquisitions — not to
                        recognize assets or liabilities as of the acquisition date for leases that,
                        as of the acquisition date, have a remaining lease term of 12 months or
                        less. Certain assets and liabilities may also result from the initial measurement
                        of acquired leases when the acquiree is a lessor. If the acquiree is the
                        lessor in an operating lease, the acquirer will generally recognize (1)
                        property subject to the lease, (2) intangible assets for favorable or
                        unfavorable terms, (3) leasehold improvements owned by the acquiree, (4)
                        intangible assets for an in-place lease, and (5) intangible assets for
                        customer relationships. When the acquiree is the lessor in a sales-type or
                        direct financing lease, the acquirer will generally recognize (1) the net
                        investment in the lease, (2) intangible assets for an in-place lease, and
                        (3) intangible assets for customer relationships."
Deloitte,Accounting Spotlight,"October 7, 2022",Accounting and Reporting Considerations for Environmental Credits,The Role of Environmental Credits,"Along with investing in carbon abatement projects that directly
                    reduce their emissions (e.g., energy efficiency upgrades, electric vehicle
                    fleets), entities are showing increased interest in purchasing carbon credits
                    generated by projects outside their operations and value chain to offset their
                    unabated emissions. Such projects may involve renewable energy initiatives in
                    developing countries, improved forest management and reforestation, lower-carbon
                    agriculture or grazing practices, direct air capture and sequestration, and many
                    other efforts.  RECs can also play an important role for entities seeking to reduce their carbon
                    footprint. Owners of renewable energy sources may be entitled to receive RECs.
                    The number of RECs awarded is typically linked to a power production formula. By
                    purchasing RECs, buyers help finance and promote renewable energy generation
                    and, in return, are allowed to use the RECs to report lower scope 2"
Deloitte,Accounting Spotlight,"October 7, 2022",Accounting and Reporting Considerations for Environmental Credits,Acquiring Environmental Credits — Trending Transactions,"While there are many ways entities can obtain environmental credits, three of the
                    more common methods are discussed below. The global voluntary carbon market is growing rapidly to
                        enable the generation, acquisition, trade, and tracking of environmental
                        credits. These markets (1) predominantly operate for environmental credits
                        that have been certified by leading standards such as the Verified Carbon
                        Standard (“Verra”) and (2) act as a mechanism through which entities can
                        actively trade and convert their environmental credits to cash.  Key types of participants in these ecosystems include: Regulatory agencies or nonprofit or for-profit organizations that
                                    set certification standards and methods as well as manage the
                                    registries to track environmental credit generation, ownership,
                                    and credit status (active or retired). The top voluntary
                                    standards and registries include Verra, the Climate Action
                                    Reserve, the American Carbon Registry, and Gold Standard. Project owners and developers that secure or
                                    provide financing, or implement and generate environmental
                                    credits, for initial sale. There is a growing number of very
                                    large project development firms. Buyers and sellers of environmental credits, which could include
                                    entities that need such credits to meet their emissions
                                    reduction goals, clean energy or fuel requirements, or mandated
                                    emissions limits. Note that a buyer of environmental credits can
                                    have various intended uses for its environmental credits. For
                                    example, an entity may plan to: Hold environmental credits and remit or retire them
                                                to the relevant agency. Immediately retire the credits to the relevant
                                                agency. Trade its environmental credits. Further, it is possible for the entity’s intended uses to change
                                    during the period over which it holds them.  A complex web of brokers and marketplace platforms to match
                                    buyers and sellers or arrange spot trades, financing, or offtake
                                    agreements. An emerging array of fund managers and financial intermediaries
                                    that are creating investment vehicles or secondary markets for
                                    environmental credits.  A power purchase agreement (PPA) is a contract between two parties: the
                        developer of a renewable energy project and a buyer. Under a PPA, the
                        developer will typically receive a fixed price for each MWh of renewable
                        energy produced and the buyer will receive the associated RECs over time as
                        the project produces and sells electricity. The recipient of the RECs (the
                        buyer) will be able to use them to reduce its gross scope 2 emissions from
                        purchased electricity. In a PPA contract, physical energy must also be
                        delivered to the buyer. By contrast, in a virtual PPA (VPPA), the buyer does not take physical
                        delivery of the power produced by the renewable energy source; instead, the
                        power component of the transaction is financially settled while the buyer
                        receives all, or a predetermined amount, of the generated RECs for each year
                        of the contract term for an agreed-upon price.  A regulator issues several categories of environmental credits, including
                        RECs. Cap-and-trade programs may also be established in which, for example,
                        (1) total annual GHG emissions from regulated entities in the program are
                        capped and (2) the cap (i.e., emissions limit) is reduced over time. Each
                        year, a volume of allowances or permits equivalent to that year’s cap are
                        auctioned or allocated (for free) to the regulated entities. As noted
                        previously, each allowance gives its owner the right to emit one MTCO2e. The
                        entity can then trade allowances until it has the volume needed to match its
                        emissions for the year. "

                        instruments and other in-scope assets when the assets have similar risk
                        characteristics. That is, the guidance does not permit an entity to measure
                        the expected credit losses on a financial asset individually unless the
                        asset has a unique risk profile that does not align with any of the other
                        assets held by the entity. ASC 326-20-30-2 states: It is important for an entity to understand how credit loss reserves have
                        historically been established so that it can evaluate the likely impact of
                        the CECL model on its existing processes. Relevant considerations include
                        the following: These considerations are
                        illustrated in the example below. 
                         Example Entity X sells goods to various retailers, which are
                                                provided with 30-day payment terms. The retailers
                                                are predominantly located in either of two
                                                geographic areas (Geography A and Geography B).
                                                Entity X has historically established its reserve
                                                for uncollectible accounts receivable by using a
                                                single aging analysis based on historical write-offs
                                                and adjustments, reserving the following: Most of X’s historical write-offs have been related
                                                to its smaller customers, and its write-off history
                                                in Geography A has been 50 percent greater than in
                                                Geography B. In addition, X routinely grants credit
                                                to customers even if they have invoices outstanding
                                                for more than 60 days. Accordingly, it is common for
                                                X to have customers with receivable balances in the
                                                current, 1–30 days past due, and 31–60 days past due
                                                aging buckets. When adopting the CECL standard, X may need to
                                                disaggregate its receivable balance into separate
                                                pools to estimate expected credit losses. This is
                                                because its historical loss information suggests
                                                that (1) the credit risk of customers in Geography A
                                                is different from that of customers in Geography B
                                                and (2) the credit risk of large customers is
                                                different from that of small customers. In addition,
                                                because a single customer may have outstanding
                                                invoice balances that span multiple aging buckets
                                                (each reserved at a different percentage), X may
                                                need to support why its existing method
                                                appropriately calculates lifetime expected credit
                                                losses for each pool. This is because invoices with
                                                the same customer or pool of customers in different
                                                aging buckets may have the same lifetime collection
                                                risk (since they are due from the same customer or
                                                pool of customers), but each invoice is being
                                                reserved at a different amount under the existing
                                                method. Further, it is likely that under the CECL
                                                model, it will no longer be appropriate to reserve 0
                                                percent for current receivables since it would be
                                                difficult for an entity to support an assertion that
                                                it expects to collect 100 percent of the current
                                                receivables balance. In applying the CECL model, X may also need to
                                                develop a process and related controls for
                                                monitoring economic conditions in Geography A and
                                                Geography B so that it can adjust its historical
                                                loss information in response to changes in market
                                                conditions that could affect expected loss
                                                rates. While commercial entities should be able to leverage existing methods when
                        developing expected loss reserves, some changes may be required to align
                        those methods with the CECL model."

Deloitte,Accounting Spotlight,"January 30, 2023","Considerations for Commercial Entities Implementing the Current Expected
        Credit Loss Standard in 2023",Use of Historical Data,"Before adoption of the CECL model, entities most likely used some form of
                        historical collection data to establish a historical loss rate and calculate
                        their reserve for uncollectible accounts related to their trade receivables
                        balance. ASC 326-20-30-8 states that “[h]istorical credit loss experience of
                        financial assets with similar risk characteristics generally provides a
                        basis for an entity’s assessment of expected credit losses.” In accordance
                        with ASC 326-20-30-9, an entity is required to consider whether the
                        historical loss rates differ from what is currently expected over the life
                        of the trade receivables (on the basis of current conditions and reasonable
                        and supportable forecasts about the future); if so, the entity should make
                        appropriate adjustments to the historical loss data. These adjustments can
                        be qualitative and should reflect changes in relevant conditions (internal
                        and external) that suggest that the historical loss information may not
                        adequately predict expected losses. If the life of a receivable is
                        relatively short, an entity may need to make only minimal adjustments to the
                        historical loss data to estimate expected credit losses. Although it may be appropriate for an entity to use historical loss
                        information to calculate a reserve for uncollectible accounts, historical
                        loss or write-off information may include invoice or receivable adjustments
                        that are not credit-related. For example, an entity’s historical write-off
                        data may include items such as those related to price concessions, volume or
                        other rebates, credit memos for returned items, credit card charge-offs, and
                        disputed balances. While all of these items could be appropriate adjustments
                        to the recorded receivables balance (i.e., adjustments that reflect amounts
                        the entity is unable to collect on the recorded receivable balance), they
                        are most likely not credit-related and could often affect the amount of
                        revenue recognized for the transaction (i.e., they may be forms of variable
                        consideration under ASC 606). Using historical loss data that include
                        write-offs unrelated to credit events could overstate the reserve recorded
                        for expected credit losses. Entities will need to ensure that they have an appropriate understanding of
                        the transactions included in the historical data they are using to calculate
                        the allowance for expected credit losses. This may be more straightforward
                        for entities with systems in which there is an identifier for each type of
                        credit loss recorded. However, many smaller entities may not have systems
                        with such capabilities. These entities might need to establish a separate
                        process to isolate credit losses in the historical data they use to estimate

                                This is because the realization of the accrued rebate is dependent
                                on offsetting amounts that would otherwise be paid to the vendor
                                rather than on the vendor’s payment of amounts when due. Some rebate programs might be structured in such a way that the
                                parties’ established practice is to apply accrued rebate receivables
                                against amounts due to the vendor, but include a cash-out feature in
                                the event that the customer-vendor relationship is terminated. These
                                arrangements may require an entity to perform additional analysis
                                and monitoring to determine the respective balances at period-end
                                (e.g., whether the amount the entity is entitled to from the vendor
                                (i.e., the receivable) is greater than the amount due to the vendor
                                (i.e., the payable), and whether there is a right to set-off) and

Deloitte,Accounting Spotlight,"October 7, 2022",Accounting and Reporting Considerations for Environmental Credits,Directly From the Regulator,"A regulator issues several categories of environmental credits, including
                        RECs. Cap-and-trade programs may also be established in which, for example,
                        (1) total annual GHG emissions from regulated entities in the program are
                        capped and (2) the cap (i.e., emissions limit) is reduced over time. Each

                        auctioned or allocated (for free) to the regulated entities. As noted
                        previously, each allowance gives its owner the right to emit one MTCO2e. The
                        entity can then trade allowances until it has the volume needed to match its
                        emissions for the year. "
Deloitte,Accounting Spotlight,"October 7, 2022",Accounting and Reporting Considerations for Environmental Credits,Accounting Practices Under Existing GAAP,"As previously noted, the treatment of environmental credits is not explicitly
                    addressed in U.S. GAAP; consequently, entities have used different approaches,
                    and questions have emerged about how to account and report for them. In the
                    sections below, we describe certain approaches that exist today in practice as
                    well as observations regarding such approaches. Note that entities should
                    carefully consider all relevant facts and circumstances when selecting an
                    appropriate accounting model to use. They should then apply such model
                    consistently and, if material, disclose their selection.  When accounting for environmental credits, entities should determine whether
                        such credits represent assets. Chapter 4 of FASB Concepts Statement 8 
                         Entities must consider all relevant facts and circumstances when                                 assessing whether their acquired or created environmental credits                                 meet the definition of an asset. For instance, we believe that                                 enhanced marketing, public claims regarding environmental                                 activities, and the potential reduction of the entity’s net                                 emissions do not, by themselves, represent an economic benefit as                                 described in Chapter 4 of Concepts Statement 8; therefore, costs
                                incurred solely from obtaining these benefits would not qualify as
                                assets.  Although still relatively new, environmental credit markets are
                                continuing to grow regionally, nationally, and internationally. We
                                do not believe that to qualify as an asset, an environmental credit
                                necessarily needs to be actively traded on an exchange. However, we
                                believe that the ability to place the environmental credit on an
                                exchange where it can be bought and sold, resulting in net cash
                                inflows, supports a conclusion that such credit meets the definition
                                of an asset.  Entities will need to carefully evaluate the nature of costs incurred
                                in connection with environmental objectives to determine whether
                                such costs meet the GAAP requirements to be capitalized and recorded
                                as an asset.  The methods used in practice for accounting for environmental credits stem
                        predominately from the accounting for emissions allowances. In informal and
                        industry-related discussions that took place a number of years ago, the FASB
                        and SEC have indicated that two methods of accounting for emission
                        allowances are acceptable: (1) an inventory model by analogy to ASC 330 An entity’s use of an accounting model will also vary on the basis of its
                        role within the market. 
                         In practice, entities generally select an accounting model on the
                                basis of the intended use for the environmental credits. For
                                instance, when an entity plans to actively trade its environmental
                                credits, it often accounts for them under an inventory model.
                                Entities need to consider the facts and circumstances of the
                                underlying arrangements and their business objectives related to
                                environmental credits to determine which accounting model is more
                                appropriate to apply. Entities also need to consider the treatment of such credits in the
                                income statement and statement of cash flows. For example, we would
                                generally expect that environmental credits accounted for as
                                inventory would be expensed as a cost of goods sold when “used” or
                                traded. Further, under an inventory model, we would usually expect
                                the activity related to environmental credits to be reflected as
                                cash flows from operations within the statement of cash flows.  While entities that participate in compliance and voluntary programs may use
                        an intangible asset model to account for environmental credits, some may not
                        strictly apply the recognition and measurement guidance under that model.
                        For instance, entities that use an intangible asset model may or may not
                        record subsequent amortization for the environmental credits. 
                         Environmental credits can be finite-lived (e.g.,
                                RECs typically have a useful life of 18 months) or infinite-lived
                                (e.g., carbon offsets have a “vintage year” that represents the year
                                in which the emissions were offset; however, they do not have an
                                expiration date). Strictly speaking, under an intangible asset
                                model, an amortization expense is required for finite-lived assets.
                                However, some have observed that environmental credits are
                                nonwasting assets. That is, if an environmental credit represents
                                the removal of one MTCO2e, regardless of the credit’s age or market
                                value, an entity can use it to offset one MTCO2e to satisfy
                                voluntary or compliance goals. Accordingly, entities will need to
                                evaluate whether amortization of certain environmental credits is
                                appropriate and, if so, the amortization method to use. Note that we have observed that a number of entities
                                do not record amortization for finite-lived environmental credits.
                                We believe that such an approach is acceptable in certain
                                circumstances. While some entities may subject environmental credits to the appropriate
                        impairment or lower-of-cost-or-market evaluation, others may believe that an
                        evaluation of impairment is not necessary. Entities in the latter group may
                        believe that their approach is justified because the intended benefits of
                        the environmental credits do not diminish until the credits are consumed
                        (e.g., used to offset emissions). Therefore, these entities may believe that
                        it is appropriate to expense the full cost of their environmental credits
                        upon use (e.g., retirement with the relevant regulatory agency or registry).  
                         We believe that under both the inventory and intangible asset models,
                                entities should subject environmental credits to the applicable
                                impairment method. The recognition of impairment adjustments under
                                these models is intended to reflect changes in the utility and
                                expected recoverability of the underlying asset.  In a manner similar to the concerns about
                                amortization, some may believe that there are challenges associated
                                with implementing an impairment model. These challenges stem from an
                                entity’s intended use for environmental credits and the credits’
                                “nonwasting” characteristic. For example, if an entity intends to
                                retire its environmental credits, some may argue that impairment
                                write-downs may not appropriately reflect the utility of the asset
                                because, regardless of market value declines, an environmental
                                credit can be used to offset one MTCO2e. However, as previously
                                noted, an entity’s intent related to its environmental credits may
                                change over time. The decision to record an asset for an environmental credit is, as                                 discussed above, based on the guidance in Chapter 4 of Concepts                                 Statement 8 and specifically on the potential for generating net
                                cash inflows. Entities should consider projected cash inflows,
                                market values, and other factors, as applicable, when determining an
                                appropriate impairment method.  Some entities immediately retire environmental credits upon purchase and
                        therefore do not record such credits as assets. Other entities may announce
                        their intention to use or offset their environmental credits for
                        sustainability reporting purposes but not formally retire them, giving rise
                        to questions regarding the appropriate time at which they should expense
                        assets recorded for environmental credits.  
                         Generally, an entity derecognizes an environmental credit once that
                                credit is officially retired with the applicable agency or registry
                                and used to offset the entity’s current emissions to demonstrate
                                compliance with mandatory or internally set goals.  Although an entity may publicly announce its intention to use an
                                environmental credit, the credit is not considered officially
                                “retired” until a request is submitted to the applicable agency or
                                registry and subsequently removed from it. Further, since an
                                entity’s intent related to its environmental credits can change over
                                time, until an environmental credit is irrevocably retired, it still
                                represents a legal right that can be transferred. We believe that the guidance in ASC 606 that describes the
                                circumstances in which an asset has been transferred may be helpful
                                in an entity’s evaluation of when to derecognize an environmental
                                credit.  Some entities participating in a compliance program only
                        record a liability associated with their emissions if the actual emissions
                        for a given period exceed the environmental credits an entity holds (i.e.,
                        an entity would need to acquire more environmental credits to satisfy its
                        obligation). However, some compliance program participants may use a model
                        in which a liability is recorded on the basis of an entity’s total
                        emissions. Under such a model, the “gross” liability associated with an
                        entity’s carbon emissions is based on the cost of acquiring the required
                        allowances and an asset is recorded for the environmental credits held by
                        the entity on the basis of the acquisition cost of any allowances
                        purchased. Generally, in a manner similar to that of a user, a producer applies either
                        the inventory or intangible asset model when accounting for environmental
                        credits; however, there is diversity in practice. In some circumstances,
                        environmental credits can be an output from a producer’s operations to
                        generate clean energy or produce sustainable goods. Producers that elect to
                        account for environmental credits under an inventory model sometimes
                        allocate a portion of production costs to the environmental credits. Other
                        producers conclude that no incremental costs are incurred for generating
                        these environmental credits; thus, no costs are allocated to the
                        environmental credits. Producers that elect to account for environmental
                        credits under an intangible asset model generally expense all associated
                        production costs as incurred because they consider the environmental credits
                        to be internally developed intangible assets. 
                         Entities need to consider the accounting model selected for
                                environmental credits, the nature of costs incurred related to the
                                creation of environmental credits, and their specific facts and
                                circumstances in determining which, if any, costs to allocate and
                                capitalize."

Deloitte,Accounting Spotlight,"October 7, 2022",Accounting and Reporting Considerations for Environmental Credits,Environmental Credits as Assets,"When accounting for environmental credits, entities should determine whether
                        such credits represent assets. Chapter 4 of FASB Concepts Statement 8 
                         Entities must consider all relevant facts and circumstances when                                 assessing whether their acquired or created environmental credits                                 meet the definition of an asset. For instance, we believe that                                 enhanced marketing, public claims regarding environmental                                 activities, and the potential reduction of the entity’s net                                 emissions do not, by themselves, represent an economic benefit as                                 described in Chapter 4 of Concepts Statement 8; therefore, costs
                                incurred solely from obtaining these benefits would not qualify as
                                assets.  Although still relatively new, environmental credit markets are
                                continuing to grow regionally, nationally, and internationally. We
                                do not believe that to qualify as an asset, an environmental credit
                                necessarily needs to be actively traded on an exchange. However, we
                                believe that the ability to place the environmental credit on an
                                exchange where it can be bought and sold, resulting in net cash
                                inflows, supports a conclusion that such credit meets the definition
                                of an asset.  Entities will need to carefully evaluate the nature of costs incurred
                                in connection with environmental objectives to determine whether
                                such costs meet the GAAP requirements to be capitalized and recorded
                                as an asset. "
Deloitte,Accounting Spotlight,"October 7, 2022",Accounting and Reporting Considerations for Environmental Credits,Classification as Either Inventory or an Intangible Asset,"The methods used in practice for accounting for environmental credits stem
                        predominately from the accounting for emissions allowances. In informal and
                        industry-related discussions that took place a number of years ago, the FASB
                        and SEC have indicated that two methods of accounting for emission
                        allowances are acceptable: (1) an inventory model by analogy to ASC 330 An entity’s use of an accounting model will also vary on the basis of its
                        role within the market. 
                         In practice, entities generally select an accounting model on the
                                basis of the intended use for the environmental credits. For
                                instance, when an entity plans to actively trade its environmental
                                credits, it often accounts for them under an inventory model.
                                Entities need to consider the facts and circumstances of the
                                underlying arrangements and their business objectives related to
                                environmental credits to determine which accounting model is more
                                appropriate to apply. Entities also need to consider the treatment of such credits in the
                                income statement and statement of cash flows. For example, we would
                                generally expect that environmental credits accounted for as
                                inventory would be expensed as a cost of goods sold when “used” or
                                traded. Further, under an inventory model, we would usually expect
                                the activity related to environmental credits to be reflected as
                                cash flows from operations within the statement of cash flows. "
Deloitte,Accounting Spotlight,"October 7, 2022",Accounting and Reporting Considerations for Environmental Credits,Amortization Under an Intangible Asset Model,"While entities that participate in compliance and voluntary programs may use
                        an intangible asset model to account for environmental credits, some may not
                        strictly apply the recognition and measurement guidance under that model.
                        For instance, entities that use an intangible asset model may or may not
                        record subsequent amortization for the environmental credits. 
                         Environmental credits can be finite-lived (e.g.,
                                RECs typically have a useful life of 18 months) or infinite-lived
                                (e.g., carbon offsets have a “vintage year” that represents the year
                                in which the emissions were offset; however, they do not have an
                                expiration date). Strictly speaking, under an intangible asset
                                model, an amortization expense is required for finite-lived assets.
                                However, some have observed that environmental credits are
                                nonwasting assets. That is, if an environmental credit represents
                                the removal of one MTCO2e, regardless of the credit’s age or market
                                value, an entity can use it to offset one MTCO2e to satisfy
                                voluntary or compliance goals. Accordingly, entities will need to
                                evaluate whether amortization of certain environmental credits is
                                appropriate and, if so, the amortization method to use. Note that we have observed that a number of entities
                                do not record amortization for finite-lived environmental credits.
                                We believe that such an approach is acceptable in certain
                                circumstances."
Deloitte,Accounting Spotlight,"October 7, 2022",Accounting and Reporting Considerations for Environmental Credits,Impairment Considerations,"While some entities may subject environmental credits to the appropriate
                        impairment or lower-of-cost-or-market evaluation, others may believe that an
                        evaluation of impairment is not necessary. Entities in the latter group may
                        believe that their approach is justified because the intended benefits of
                        the environmental credits do not diminish until the credits are consumed
                        (e.g., used to offset emissions). Therefore, these entities may believe that
                        it is appropriate to expense the full cost of their environmental credits
                        upon use (e.g., retirement with the relevant regulatory agency or registry).  
                         We believe that under both the inventory and intangible asset models,
                                entities should subject environmental credits to the applicable
                                impairment method. The recognition of impairment adjustments under
                                these models is intended to reflect changes in the utility and
                                expected recoverability of the underlying asset.  In a manner similar to the concerns about
                                amortization, some may believe that there are challenges associated
                                with implementing an impairment model. These challenges stem from an
                                entity’s intended use for environmental credits and the credits’
                                “nonwasting” characteristic. For example, if an entity intends to
                                retire its environmental credits, some may argue that impairment
                                write-downs may not appropriately reflect the utility of the asset
                                because, regardless of market value declines, an environmental
                                credit can be used to offset one MTCO2e. However, as previously
                                noted, an entity’s intent related to its environmental credits may
                                change over time. The decision to record an asset for an environmental credit is, as                                 discussed above, based on the guidance in Chapter 4 of Concepts                                 Statement 8 and specifically on the potential for generating net
                                cash inflows. Entities should consider projected cash inflows,
                                market values, and other factors, as applicable, when determining an
                                appropriate impairment method. "
Deloitte,Accounting Spotlight,"October 7, 2022",Accounting and Reporting Considerations for Environmental Credits,Timing of Expense,"Some entities immediately retire environmental credits upon purchase and
                        therefore do not record such credits as assets. Other entities may announce
                        their intention to use or offset their environmental credits for
                        sustainability reporting purposes but not formally retire them, giving rise
                        to questions regarding the appropriate time at which they should expense
                        assets recorded for environmental credits.  
                         Generally, an entity derecognizes an environmental credit once that
                                credit is officially retired with the applicable agency or registry
                                and used to offset the entity’s current emissions to demonstrate
                                compliance with mandatory or internally set goals.  Although an entity may publicly announce its intention to use an
                                environmental credit, the credit is not considered officially
                                “retired” until a request is submitted to the applicable agency or
                                registry and subsequently removed from it. Further, since an
                                entity’s intent related to its environmental credits can change over
                                time, until an environmental credit is irrevocably retired, it still
                                represents a legal right that can be transferred. We believe that the guidance in ASC 606 that describes the
                                circumstances in which an asset has been transferred may be helpful
                                in an entity’s evaluation of when to derecognize an environmental
                                credit. "
Deloitte,Accounting Spotlight,"October 7, 2022",Accounting and Reporting Considerations for Environmental Credits,Liabilities for Environmental Credits,"Some entities participating in a compliance program only
                        record a liability associated with their emissions if the actual emissions
                        for a given period exceed the environmental credits an entity holds (i.e.,
                        an entity would need to acquire more environmental credits to satisfy its
                        obligation). However, some compliance program participants may use a model
                        in which a liability is recorded on the basis of an entity’s total
                        emissions. Under such a model, the “gross” liability associated with an
                        entity’s carbon emissions is based on the cost of acquiring the required
                        allowances and an asset is recorded for the environmental credits held by
                        the entity on the basis of the acquisition cost of any allowances
                        purchased."
Deloitte,Accounting Spotlight,"October 7, 2022",Accounting and Reporting Considerations for Environmental Credits,Producers of Environmental Credits,"Generally, in a manner similar to that of a user, a producer applies either
                        the inventory or intangible asset model when accounting for environmental
                        credits; however, there is diversity in practice. In some circumstances,
                        environmental credits can be an output from a producer’s operations to
                        generate clean energy or produce sustainable goods. Producers that elect to
                        account for environmental credits under an inventory model sometimes
                        allocate a portion of production costs to the environmental credits. Other
                        producers conclude that no incremental costs are incurred for generating
                        these environmental credits; thus, no costs are allocated to the
                        environmental credits. Producers that elect to account for environmental
                        credits under an intangible asset model generally expense all associated
                        production costs as incurred because they consider the environmental credits
                        to be internally developed intangible assets. 
                         Entities need to consider the accounting model selected for

                    on several occasions beginning in 2003, it has yet to finalize a project on this
                    topic. In June 2021, the Board issued an  In addition to issuing the ITC, the Board performed outreach to better understand
                    how various entities currently account for environmental credits. Through this
                    outreach, the Board observed significant diversity in practice among users and
                    producers of environmental credits as well among entities operating in voluntary
                    and compliance programs.  In response to stakeholder feedback on the ITC and the results of its outreach,

                    calculated and traced for the purpose of offsetting an entity’s GHG emissions.”  Registrants would also be required to disclose how much of their progress toward
