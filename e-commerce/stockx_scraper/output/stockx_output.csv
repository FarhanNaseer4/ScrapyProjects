This is the first Kobe 6 to receive the Kobe Protro treatment, a design process that takes classic Kobe designs and updates them with modern tech for improved performance.

A black Swoosh, red Kobe branding on the tongue, and green translucent outsole accentuate the shoe’s reptile theme. But, because this is a Protro, there are some differences. The updated Kobe 6 Grinch arrives with a more responsive Zoom Air cushioning system and scaled-down traction for an improved court feel.
