PetLab Dog Clippers Professional Dog Grooming for Small Medium Large Breeds Low Noise Rechargeable Cordless Dog Grooming Clippers Electric Pet Clippers for Dogs Cats Pets Hair Trimmer,PetLab,"2,777 global ratings",4.3 out of 5,Anna A.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Was easy to use with the dog which is usually very nervous,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 24 March 2021,Verified Purchase,"My dog is usually very nervous around clippers, but with this one we've made a lot of progress. The low noise and low speed option is very helpful, and cordless devise works so much better for us than the corded one, as I was able to keep the process going while my dog was constantly changing his place. The device itself is lightweight, easy to clean. One battery charge was enough to have the job done (we do not shave our dog completely, just thinning the overgrown parts around back legs, tail, collar, and paws; but as our dog has very thick double coat, I'd say the battery performance was great). Several accessories are included, different size heads were useful, scissors are very sharp and doing a great job. The only tool that wasn't particularly useful for us is the nail clipper, as our dogs are large and require a bit stronger tool, but would perfectly work for medium-small dogs range and other smaller pets. Overall, great product, no regrets.",200 people found this helpful,16-08-2022 04:32:34

His fear is really focused on those scissors and people he doesn't know. So I decided to substitute with a clipper instead to get the job done. With this grooming set I have already cut my dogs hair twice-no problems at all. It’s really powerful,blades are sharp but surprisingly low noise.

I am so pleased with the quality of all the items included. We only used the nail clippers on our cat. They are very sharp and cut through the nails with no effort. The metal grooming brush is amazing comparing to some we had in the past. It has rounded bristles at the bottom which means they won't scratch the skin while brushing fur. I'm actually keeping the rest of the items for the rest of the family to use. I've used the scissors to trim my daughters hair. They are very good quality hair scissors, sharp and clean off very easily.

A dog feels more relaxed and it’s easier for both sides.The only small minus for me of this set was that the blade quite big, not very comfortable to use on a small dog.

This works fine but them being wired can be a little frustrating at times and with the addition of other things in this kit I thought I'd give it a shot. I was also interested to see how much better ceramic and titanium blades would be than just titanium.I charged up the device etc and set up my grooming table. After a shapoo and blow dry with a comb I was ready to start cutting the hair. I was disappointed pretty much from the start and my dog wasn't impressed either.Firstly due to it being battery powered as opposed to mains you can audiably hear the speed of the trimmers slow down when a little more than a few strands of hair are in it grasps. I think this is where the main problems stem from.The 'ceramic' looks and feels like plastic and is not as good as my pure metal Wahl pair.Hair snags between the plastic clip-on length guided and the blades causing pulled hair for the dog which isn't nice at all.The grooves in the blades are tiny meaning it barely cuts any hair. This makes the grooming process incredibly laborious and slow with you having to clean clumps of hair out from the plastic every pass or so.The scissors are a bit of a joke and pretty much just squish hair between them unless you force your fingers to apply pressure to the blades. The tightening mechanism also doesn't work on them, perhaps that's just for show.I didn't use the nail clippers as they looked like a toy in comparison to my usual pair.I was hoping this set wouldn't be another bit of 'cheap rubbish from China' but of course it was. I'll be returning them soon as they are so unfit for purpose it's a joke.",15 people found this helpful,16-08-2022 04:32:48

Due to the heat wave and for planning by myself I was unable to get her in with a groomer for the heat wave. So I decided to purchase these clippers and they came the next day. Everything seemed well packaged and not used, however there was no cellophane wrap around the box. I thought them on charge before I used them, they were already at 75% straight out the box. The noise level is very quiet and did not frighten my pooch. They are very easy to use and the fact that you can change the power is a nice touch. Having said that I used the 9 mm guard for her whole body then 3mm to trim her tummy and longer bits to her legs. Do not use the 3 mm blade around the ears, I did this and unfortunately I cut my dogs ear. Remember to take your time when using them, as the clippers do not detect hair from skin. If you are looking for a grooming kit at a reasonable price, this one ticks all the boxes! My dog looks like she has been to a junior groomer, but she seems a lot happier now in the 40° heat!",2 people found this helpful,16-08-2022 04:32:56

So after reading a few of the reviews and seeing that this was the number 1 selling Dog Clippers i took the plunge as it cost less than one dogs visit to the pooch Parlour.The clippers arrived promptly via Amazon and I was impressed at the quality of the accessories and feel of the clippers themselves. So I put them on charge to make sure it was fully charged before I tried to use them. Then came the daunting part actually clipping the dogs. I started with my male as he needed a cut where as my female had only recently been to the parlour.The clippers buzzed into action and started quickly removing the hair but after a few strokes it started to become harder and harder to get the clippers through the dogs coat. I tried cleaning the clippers fully and giving them a charge even though it was telling me they were still over 75% charged but when I went back to continue the clipping it was still seeming to struggle cutting and seems that with less than half a dog the clippers have already lost there sharpness which is extremely frustrating and disappointing. Eventually I managed to get about 80%% of my springer spaniel clipped and cut using the included scissors but have now got no option but to return them and have had to take my poor pooch to the parlour to be finished off.Maybe it just isn’t compatible with the thickness of a springers coat and will work on finer dogs hair but unfortunately I can not recommend these due to mine and my poor dogs experience.,,16-08-2022 04:32:59

These clippers were great - not too loud (we used the slowest setting as my dogs are noise sensitive, but it was powerful enough to cut through thick fur &amp; the only time the noise/vibration bothered them was when used on the top of their heads). We had an old pair of corded clippers which were awful - you could feel the vibration through your hand and even if you touched the cord. None of that with these, very easy to use, and comfortable in the hand. I did one large and one medium dog and the charge only went down 25% so plenty for my needs. Fur builds up on the clippers so you need to pull it away as you go, but that's fairly standard, plus my dogs both have quite thick fur. Kit comes with lots of bits I didn't really need, but always lovely to have more nail files and scissors so not a problem. Excellent price, and will save me a fortune on dog grooming in the future.",,16-08-2022 04:32:59

Came fully charged so could just pop the battery in and get on with it.  Handset is lighter than our previous corded clippers.  Good quality accessories.Bad points: All the controls are where you would want to hold the clippers so I kept switching them off or changing the speed up and down which is annoying if you have got the dog in a certain position only for them to cut out plus with a curly coated dog like ours slowing the speed seemed to just snag in his coat.  Also found that the amount of charge kept changing, presuming they would not last 2 to 3 hours at full speed, it took nearly an hour combining clippers with scissor work and dropped to 25% charge and seemed to be lagging.  Also noticed the metal part of the blades got really hot so kept switching them off to let them cool off.All in all a good value product for the half price offer, don't think they would ever be worth full price.

I've used my own hair clippers in the past on him but found them too big and too noisy so decided to get these clippers a try. They are probably the worst clippers I've ever used. They are actually quite noisy. I then tried to do a light trim on his back but it pulled his hair off on the first stroke rather than cutting it. I tried trimming the hair on the back of his leg which is finer but there too it pulled his hair. These clippers aren't sharp at all. Anyways long story short, I'm sending them back straight away.

Very light weight and easy to use and cut through my westies coat like a hot knife through butter. Arrived with 50% battery life ready to use straight away although disappointed with the scissors that came with this set they were BLUNT and couldn't use them, another niggle, the handset (clipper) when you hold it yr hand rests on the stop button, and or the minus button which stops the clipper working and or slows it down a notch, think because if it had been placed at the bottom end of  the clipper, it would stop this, stop/ slow down, from occurring.Very easy noise reduction clipper lightweight and a view bar to see how much battery life you have and slow or fast + &amp;  - buttons too.

It works lightly and smoothly , I think that because to the titanium ceramic blades and good drive. It's good to hold in your hand. . It is pretty precise to the wide range of blade adjustment- it is important to me. Attached 4 comb overlays of different lengths. It has functional amenities, you can regulate the speed of operation and see the battery level on the display. The battery seems to be efficient. After 30 minutes of cutting, about 20% of the energy was lost on the medium setting. The manufacturer declares a low sound level. It's not silent, but I find this working sound quite friendly compared to other hair clippers I've used. As for me, the best clippers I have ever had. However, I am not satisfied with the scissors attached, although they look solid, but they jammed, so at times they tugged at the hair that was stuck in them. I had to use my old scissors. Other accessories : comb, nail clipper and nails file, are fine.In my opinion, the hair clipper is worth recommending.  Comfortable cordless. It also looks very nice.The disadvantage of the set proved to be a pair of scissors,  but maybe I was unlucky to have a faulty one .",6 people found this helpful,16-08-2022 04:37:14

They're as quiet as one could reasonably expect and cut well with nothing catching.The scissors aren't amazing but are acceptable.The spring in the nail clippers keeps falling out, so I'll probably glue that in at some point, but again, the clippers themselves are fine, at least for my light usage.I can't vouch for how well this set would stand up against thicker hair and nails, but for my usage and the price I paid, I'm really happy with it.Customer service were also very helpful in sending out a replacement part.Update 10 weeks later: my now 6-month old cocker spaniel is developing her adult coat and when used with the guard, the clippersdo occasionally get stuck. I won't amend the 5* review because, for the price (less than one professional groom), this set was the perfect place to start getting my puppy (and myself) used to grooming, but I'm afraid I might now  be approaching the time to move to a more powerful set of clippers.",,16-08-2022 04:39:43

El set es muy completo, se trata más bien de un set de spa para mascotas en vez de un cortador de pelo, ¡los animalillos quedarán encantados! Es fácil de usar aunque no tengo habilidad usando estas máquinas y creo que debería haber usado un corte más largo para empezar. Trae diferentes cabezales para diferentes largos.Tambien trae muchos accesorios, las tijeras son estupendas y muy profesionales, de hecho, me las quedé para mi.La máquina funciona con una batería extraíble y recargable.La única pega es que creí que sería un poco más silenciosa de acuerdo a la descripción, pero no me importa ya que no es incómodo.Diría que esta máquina de cortar el pelo está diseñada tanto para mascotas como para humanos.",7 people found this helpful,16-08-2022 04:39:56

Quando anche il nostro toelettatore di fiducia ha chiuso l’attività ho deciso di provare a prendermi cura di Rommy acquistando questo kit. Sono molto soddisfatta di questo prodotto, anche se non sono riuscita a tosarlo alla perfezione perché dopo un’ora il bassotto si è seccato e se n’è andato ma il rasoio è dotato di una buonissima lama, pettine in metallo e due tipi di forbici. In dotazione anche una lima per unghie ed un tagliaunghie. Prestate solo attenzione alle forbici  dentellate perché possono tirare il pelo dei nostri amici e spazientirli. Per stressarlo meno ho accorciato prima il pelo con la forbice ed ho usato il rasoio, leggero ma preciso. Devo migliorare ma la prospettiva di potermi prendere cura del mio peloso e potere risparmiare una discreta somma mi fanno sentire motivata.
