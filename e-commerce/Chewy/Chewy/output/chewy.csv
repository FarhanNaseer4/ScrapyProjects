For this reason, it is extremely important to follow a gradual transition plan to best support your pet's health and product effectiveness. It is recommended to follow at least a 7-day transition plan before exclusively feeding your pet a new food. Cats will often refuse mixed diets, so we recommend adding the new food to a separate bowl from the old food. Start by mixing 75% of your pet's current diet with 25% of the new diet on Day 1 and Day 2. On Day 3 and Day 4, mix 50% of the current diet with 50% of the new diet. On Day 5 and Day 6, mix 25% of the current diet with 75% of the new diet. On Day 7, you can feed your pet the new food exclusively.

Increased water intake can be beneficial for kidney function. | TRANSITION_INSTRUCTIONS | Pets can be sensitive to sudden changes in their diets. For this reason, it is extremely important to follow a gradual transition plan to best support your pet's health and product effectiveness. It is recommended to follow a 7 to 14-day transition plan before exclusively feeding your pet a new food. Cats will often refuse mixed diets, so we recommend adding the new food to a separate bowl from the old food. For a 14-day transition plan, start by mixing 75% of your pet's current diet with 25% of the new diet on Days 1-4. On Days 5-8, mix 50% of the current diet with 50% of the new diet. On Days 9-11, mix 25% of the current diet with 75% of the new diet. On Days 12-14, you can feed your pet the new food exclusively. Ask your Veterinarian about the best way to transition your pet to a new food.

For this reason, it is extremely important to follow a gradual transition plan to best support your pet's health and product effectiveness. It is recommended to follow at least a 7-day transition plan before exclusively feeding your pet a new food. Cats will often refuse mixed diets, so we recommend adding the new food to a separate bowl from the old food. Start by mixing 75% of your pet's current diet with 25% of the new diet on Day 1 and Day 2. On Day 3 and Day 4, mix 50% of the current diet with 50% of the new diet. On Day 5 and Day 6, mix 25% of the current diet with 75% of the new diet. On Day 7, you can feed your pet the new food exclusively. Ask your Veterinarian about the best way to transition your pet to a new food.

Be sure to have a clean bowl of cool, fresh water available at all times. Increased water intake can be beneficial for kidney function. | TRANSITION_INSTRUCTIONS | Pets can be sensitive to sudden changes in their diets. For this reason, it is extremely important to follow a gradual transition plan to best support your pet's health and product effectiveness. It is recommended to follow a 7 to 14-day transition plan before exclusively feeding your pet a new food. Cats will often refuse mixed diets, so we recommend adding the new food to a separate bowl from the old food. For a 14-day transition plan, start by mixing 75% of your pet's current diet with 25% of the new diet on Days 1-4. On Days 5-8, mix 50% of the current diet with 50% of the new diet. On Days 9-11, mix 25% of the current diet with 75% of the new diet. On Days 12-14, you can feed your pet the new food exclusively. Ask your Veterinarian about the best way to transition your pet to a new food.

For this reason, it is extremely important to follow a gradual transition plan to best support your pet's health and product effectiveness. It is recommended to follow at least a 7-day transition plan before exclusively feeding your pet a new food. Cats will often refuse mixed diets, so we recommend adding the new food to a separate bowl from the old food. Start by mixing 75% of your pet's current diet with 25% of the new diet on Day 1 and Day 2. On Day 3 and Day 4, mix 50% of the current diet with 50% of the new diet. On Day 5 and Day 6, mix 25% of the current diet with 75% of the new diet. On Day 7, you can feed your pet the new food exclusively. Ask your Veterinarian about the best way to transition your pet to a new food.

For this reason, it is extremely important to follow a gradual transition plan to best support your pet's health and product effectiveness. It is recommended to follow at least a 7-day transition plan before exclusively feeding your pet a new food. Cats will often refuse mixed diets, so we recommend adding the new food to a separate bowl from the old food. Start by mixing 75% of your pet's current diet with 25% of the new diet on Day 1 and Day 2. On Day 3 and Day 4, mix 50% of the current diet with 50% of the new diet. On Day 5 and Day 6, mix 25% of the current diet with 75% of the new diet. On Day 7, you can feed your pet the new food exclusively. Ask your Veterinarian about the best way to transition your pet to a new food.
